class Aux:
    """
    Aux is the class that works as a pipeline to load, write, and upload all video from S3 bucket.

    Attributes
    ----------
        _s3: botocore.client.S3
            An internal variable to talk to S3.

        _temp_folder: string
            An internal variable for temp folder path.

        _local_path: string
            An internal variable for local folder path.


    Methods
    ---------
        load_s3(bucket, prefix) -> list[Video]:
            Loads in video files as Video classes into a list from S3.

        load_local(path) -> list[Video]:
            Loads in video files as Video classes into a list from local machine.

        upload_s3(video_list, bucket, prefix) -> None:
            Uploads the contents of the temp folder to S3. Bucket can be specifed, and the prefix is the path
            to the folder within that bucket where the output videos should end up.

        execute_label_and_write_local(video_list) -> List[Video]:
            Super important function to execute any pending labels on video list. This is how the FFmpeg
            command is run, and if further processing is needed, it returns a processed video list.

        clean() -> None:
            Removes the temp directory and anything within it. Really useful for a debug, and everything
            should be cleaned up after uploading to S3. (Unless you want to keep the files locally)

        set_local_path(path) -> None:
            If the local path is not set by the time the video is ready to be uploaded, set the path to the
            output folder.
    Examples
    ---------
        load_s3(bucket='aeye-data-bucket', prefix='input_video/') -> Loads everything from the aEye data bucket in the input_video
        directory.

        load_local('/documents/testVid.mp4') -> Loads video directly from the local file location

        upload_s3(modified_video_list, 'aeye-data-bucket', 'output_videos/')

        execute_label_and_write_local(list_of_videos) -> Executes the pending labels for all video objects in the list

        clean() -> Cleans the temp folder

        set_local_path(cur_path) -> sets the local path to whatever you pass it. Unlikely a user will need this
